# Platform Guide: Claude Code

Use this reference when the pipeline runs inside Claude Code.

## Environment Shape

- Hook support is rich and event-driven.
- Plugin packaging is supported through `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
- Dedicated subagent definitions normally live in `.claude/agents/`.
- Additional instruction files can live in `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/rules/*.md`.
- Hypo-Workflow is not a runner. Claude Code performs the actual work while `.pipeline/` remains the workflow source of truth.

## Recommended Settings Template

Example `/.claude/settings.local.json` for project-local hooks:

```json
{
  "hooks": {},
  "agents": {}
}
```

## Hook 手动安装

将以下内容添加到 `.claude/settings.local.json`：

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash hooks/stop-check.sh",
            "timeout": 5000
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "startup|clear",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash hooks/session-start.sh startup",
            "timeout": 3000
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "resume",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash hooks/session-start.sh resume",
            "timeout": 3000
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "compact",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash hooks/session-start.sh compact",
            "timeout": 3000
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Plugin Installation

Typical flow:

1. place the skill directory in the repository
2. load the plugin with `claude --plugin-dir <Hypo-Workflow repo>` for local development, or install it through a Claude Code marketplace for persistent use
3. verify that the plugin namespace is `hw` and that `skills/plan/SKILL.md` resolves as `/hw:plan`
4. run `/hw:setup` to create `~/.hypo-workflow/config.yaml`

To use Codex for delegated steps, install `@openai/codex`, configure `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and set global `subagent.provider=codex` through setup.

## Subagent Paths

Preferred order:

1. `.claude/agents/<name>.md`
2. built-in Claude subagent routing
3. `claude -p` for explicit non-interactive delegation

## Hook Usage Guidance

Claude hooks can enrich the pipeline with:

- prompt start summaries
- decision-block stop enforcement
- state snapshotting
- structured event propagation through `additionalContext`

Key V3 behavior:

- Stop Hook can block premature termination with `decision:block`
- SessionStart reinjects pipeline state on startup, resume, and compact
- InstructionsLoaded can observe `SKILL.md` loads without changing control flow

Even in Claude Code, hooks should reinforce the state machine, not replace it.

## C6 Hook Runtime

Generated settings register `node hooks/claude-hook.mjs <EventName>` for:

- `SessionStart`
- `Stop`
- `PreCompact`
- `PostCompact`
- `PostToolUse`
- `PostToolBatch`
- `UserPromptSubmit`
- `PermissionRequest`
- `FileChanged(.pipeline/PROGRESS.md)`

Stop blocks missing workflow-critical evidence: `.pipeline/state.yaml`, `.pipeline/log.yaml`, `.pipeline/PROGRESS.md`, and the current report when the final milestone step is complete. Metrics and derived-refresh gaps are warning-only so they do not deadlock routine exits.

Compact hooks emit a short resume packet with Cycle, current Milestone/prompt, current step, next action, required files, automation state, and recent events. The packet explicitly tells Claude not to replay completed steps and to trust `.pipeline/state.yaml`.

PermissionRequest follows `claude_code.profile`:

- `developer`: allow local automation.
- `standard`: ask for protected workflow files, destructive commands, and external side effects.
- `strict`: deny protected/destructive/external actions and allow only low-risk actions.

## C6 Adapter Profiles

Claude Code adapter configuration uses three safety profiles:

- `developer`: permissive local development mode.
- `standard`: published default, with confirmation for destructive or external side effects.
- `strict`: conservative team/CI mode.

The adapter should preserve existing `.claude/` configuration, merge only Hypo-managed settings, and back up `.claude/settings.local.json` before first mutation.

## Safe Settings Merge

`hypo-workflow sync --platform claude-code` owns marker-bearing hook entries and the managed main-session model in `.claude/settings.local.json`:

- `model`: generated from `claude_code.model`, defaulting to `deepseek-v4-pro`
- hook groups marked with `hypo_workflow_managed: true`
- metadata under `hypo_workflow.managed_by=hypo-workflow`

Existing user keys such as `env`, user-managed plugin configuration, and non-managed hook groups are preserved. Existing managed hook groups and managed model value are replaceable on rerun. A user-owned hook command that matches a Hypo-managed command, or a user-owned `model` value that differs from `claude_code.model`, is treated as a conflict; sync reports manual confirmation and does not rewrite the settings file.

Before changing an existing settings file, sync creates `.claude/settings.local.json.bak.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`. Rerunning sync after no content change is idempotent and does not create another backup.

## Model Routing

Claude Code subagents derive model choices from the shared model pool. C6 defaults keep docs on DeepSeek V4 Pro and code/test roles on Mimo V2.5 Pro, with explicit project overrides allowed through `claude_code.agents`.

`hypo-workflow sync --platform claude-code` writes marker-managed `.claude/agents/hw-*.md` files plus `.claude/hypo-workflow-agents.json` metadata. User-owned same-name agent files are not overwritten; sync records a conflict for manual resolution.

Dynamic selection is advisory and inspectable:

- documentation tasks select `docs`
- implementation tasks select `code`
- active Test Profiles select `test`
- retry/failure states select `debug`
- report/release work selects `report`
- compact/context work selects `compact`

Hypo-Workflow does not invoke these models directly. Claude Code owns actual subagent execution and model calls.

## Status Surface

C6 exposes a read-only Claude status surface built from the canonical workflow files:

- `.pipeline/PROGRESS.md` supplies the compact current summary, basic settings table, milestone table, and timeline rows.
- `.pipeline/state.yaml` supplies phase, step, next action, progress count, and lifecycle status through the shared status model.
- `.pipeline/log.yaml` supplies fallback recent events when the Progress timeline is missing.

The surface is intentionally a projection. It must not create an action panel, mutate workflow state, or paste raw logs/secrets into Claude output.

Status refresh is event-driven:

- `FileChanged(.pipeline/PROGRESS.md)` and progress-touching tool events attach a `claude_status` snapshot to the hook result.
- `ProgressMonitor` returns a short notification plus Markdown status context.
- `/hw:status` aliases should present the same compact model instead of dumping all of `PROGRESS.md`.

Monitor capability finding: Claude Code plugin docs include monitor packaging, but C6 does not assume a persistent native panel/status slot. The validated fallback order is:

1. monitor notification from `monitors/monitors.json`
2. `/hw:status` compact output
3. SessionStart/Stop injected summary
4. dashboard link or explicit launch guidance
