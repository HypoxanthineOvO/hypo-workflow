# Commands Spec

Use this reference when the user's message starts with `/hw:` or when exact command parsing matters more than fuzzy natural-language intent matching.

## Namespace

- all explicit Hypo-Workflow commands use the `/hw:` prefix
- V10.1 canonical namespace contains 32 user-facing commands across Setup, Pipeline, Plan, Lifecycle, and Utility groups, plus an internal cron-only watchdog skill
- slash commands are exact and namespace-scoped
- slash commands take precedence over fuzzy natural-language matching
- natural-language commands remain valid for backward compatibility

## Parsing Rules

1. treat the first whitespace-delimited token as the command name
2. recognized commands are:
   - `/hw:start`
   - `/hw:resume`
   - `/hw:status`
   - `/hw:skip`
   - `/hw:stop`
   - `/hw:report`
   - `/hw:help`
   - `/hw:reset`
   - `/hw:log`
   - `/hw:setup`
   - `/hw:dashboard`
   - `/hw:knowledge`
   - `/hw:compact`
   - `/hw:guide`
- `/hw:showcase`
- `/hw:rules`
- `/hw:check`
- `/hw:init`
- `/hw:release`
- `/hw:audit`
- `/hw:debug`
- `/hw:chat`
- `/hw:plan`
   - `/hw:plan:discover`
   - `/hw:plan:decompose`
   - `/hw:plan:generate`
   - `/hw:plan:confirm`
   - `/hw:plan:extend`
   - `/hw:plan:review`
   - `/hw:cycle`
   - `/hw:patch`
3. parse remaining tokens as command arguments
4. flags are order-independent
5. if a command is unknown, return exactly:
   `Unknown command: /hw:xxx. Available: /hw:start, /hw:resume, /hw:status, /hw:skip, /hw:stop, /hw:report, /hw:plan, /hw:plan:discover, /hw:plan:decompose, /hw:plan:generate, /hw:plan:confirm, /hw:plan:extend, /hw:plan:review, /hw:cycle, /hw:patch, /hw:compact, /hw:knowledge, /hw:guide, /hw:showcase, /hw:rules, /hw:init, /hw:check, /hw:audit, /hw:release, /hw:debug, /hw:help, /hw:reset, /hw:log, /hw:setup, /hw:dashboard`
6. if a known command receives an unsupported flag, stop and report the unsupported flag explicitly instead of guessing
7. if a prompt selector is ambiguous, list the candidates and stop
8. plan and review commands load `plan/PLAN-SKILL.md` before execution
9. if a command starts with `/hw:plan:` and is unknown, return exactly:
   `Unknown command: /hw:plan:xxx. Available: /hw:plan, /hw:plan:discover, /hw:plan:decompose, /hw:plan:generate, /hw:plan:confirm, /hw:plan:extend, /hw:plan:review`
10. append-mode conflicts must never silently renumber executed prompts
11. `/hw:review` is a compatibility alias that prints a migration warning instead of running the review directly

## Command Semantics

### `/hw:start`

Supported flags:

- `--from <prompt>`
- `--clean`

Behavior:

- read `.pipeline/config.yaml`
- read `~/.hypo-workflow/config.yaml` if present
- resolve effective config as project > global > defaults before selecting execution mode or subagent provider
- validate config before mutating state
- if `--clean` is present, treat the action as a restart and reinitialize from `assets/state-init.yaml`
- if unfinished state exists and `--clean` is absent, resume that state instead of silently discarding it
- if `--from <prompt>` is present, resolve against prompt filename or prompt stem prefix
- when `--from` is used, initialize `current.prompt_file` directly to the matched prompt
- do not fabricate history entries for prompts that were never executed
- create `.pipeline/.lock` during active execution
- update top-level `last_heartbeat` whenever state is persisted
- if `watchdog.enabled=true`, register cron for `scripts/watchdog.sh`

### `/hw:resume`

Supported flags:

- `--template <name>`

Preconditions:

- `state.yaml` exists
- state indicates unfinished work, usually `pipeline.status=running|stopped`

Notes:

- user-facing "interrupted" means persisted unfinished state
- V4.5 does not require a literal `pipeline.status=interrupted` enum

Behavior:

- read `state.yaml`
- stop if `.pipeline/.lock` already exists
- create `.pipeline/.lock` before active execution
- locate `current.prompt_file` and `current.step`
- continue from the next runnable step
- update top-level `last_heartbeat` whenever state is persisted

### `/hw:status`

Supported flags:

- none
- `--full`

Behavior:

- prefer `scripts/state-summary.sh`
- without `--full`, prefer `.pipeline/state.compact.yaml` and `.pipeline/PROGRESS.compact.md` when present
- with `--full`, ignore compact files and load complete `.pipeline/state.yaml` plus `.pipeline/PROGRESS.md`
- if the script is unavailable, fall back to direct config/state inspection
- include the effective execution mode when config files are available
- include active Cycle metadata, `last_heartbeat`, and watchdog state when present
- include project-root `PROJECT-SUMMARY.md` top summary when present
- do not mutate `state.yaml`, `log.md`, `log.yaml`, or reports

### `/hw:skip`

Supported flags:

- `--reason <text>`

Preconditions:

- the pipeline has an active current prompt
- the pipeline is currently resumable, usually `pipeline.status=running|stopped`

Behavior:

- mark the current prompt as skipped
- store the skip reason when provided, otherwise use a concise default such as `user_skipped`
- append a prompt-level skip log event
- write one history entry with `result=skipped`
- do not increment `pipeline.prompts_completed`
- advance directly to the next prompt
- if there is no next prompt, mark the pipeline `completed`

### `/hw:stop`

Supported flags:

- `--no-report`

Preconditions:

- the pipeline has active unfinished work

Behavior:

- persist the current prompt state
- set `pipeline.status=stopped`
- if `--no-report` is absent, write an intermediate report for the current prompt
- append one prompt-level stop event
- do not advance the prompt
- do not mark the prompt aborted
- remove `.pipeline/.lock`
- unregister watchdog cron because the stop is intentional

### `/hw:report`

Supported flags:

- none
- `--view M<N>`

Behavior:

- without `--view`, list `.pipeline/reports.compact.md` summaries when available
- with `--view M<N>`, load the specified Milestone report in full
- locate the most recent report using `history.completed_prompts[-1].report_file` when available
- otherwise fall back to the newest report file in the reports directory
- summarize the latest scores, warnings, and decision

### `/hw:help`

Supported forms:

- `/hw:help`
- `/hw:help --quick`
- `/hw:help <cmd>`

Behavior:

- read `SKILL.md` command tables as the source of truth
- `/hw:help` lists all 32 user-facing commands grouped under Setup, Pipeline, Plan, Lifecycle, and Utility
- `/hw:help --quick` returns a compact cheat sheet
- `/hw:help <cmd>` returns detailed usage, flags, and examples for the requested command

### `/hw:reset`

Supported flags:

- none
- `--full`
- `--hard`

Behavior:

- `/hw:reset` resets `state.yaml` to an initial state and preserves config, prompts, architecture, and logs
- `/hw:reset --full` removes state plus generated reports and lifecycle logs while preserving config, prompts, and architecture
- `/hw:reset --hard` removes the entire `.pipeline/` directory after printing the delete list and receiving an explicit `YES`

### `/hw:log`

Supported flags:

- `/hw:chat` reloads Workflow context from `state.yaml + cycle.yaml + PROGRESS.md + recent report`
- enter append conversation mode without opening a new Milestone
- keep discussion and small modifications in chat log rather than Milestone report
- `/hw:chat end` explicitly closes chat mode and writes a chat summary when required

- with `--batch`, Discover covers multiple Features in one interview and generates a Feature Queue after confirmation
- Progressive Discover starts by asking task category, desired effect, and verification method before deeper implementation detail
- map task category to Test Profile expectations when applicable; webapp, agent-service, and research each require different validation evidence
- with `--insert <natural language>`, interpret the natural-language request as a structured queue operation, summarize the queue diff, and wait for explicit confirmation before writing `.pipeline/feature-queue.yaml`
- supported insert operations include append, insert before/after, reprioritize, pause with `gate: confirm`, move queued Features, and update queued Feature title/summary/decompose mode
- `--insert` must not reorder active, done, blocked, or deferred Features unless the user explicitly requests repair surgery
- with `--batch`, resolve `batch.decompose_mode`:
  - `upfront`: decompose all Features before execution

- with `--batch`, generate Feature Queue Markdown tables and Mermaid graphs for dependencies and architecture impact
- when `--context` is omitted, use active `cycle.context_sources` when present

- default to `/hw:plan:discover` when no explicit sub-phase is given
- do not start normal pipeline execution yet

### `/hw:plan:discover`

Supported flags:

- `--template <name>`

Behavior:

- load `plan/PLAN-SKILL.md`
- inspect the current repository when applicable
- gather goals, constraints, and stack assumptions
- ask task category, desired effect, and verification method before narrower follow-up questions
- if the category is `research`, ask baseline, expected direction, and validation script before leaving Discover
- write or update `.pipeline/design-spec.md`
- persist intermediate planning state in `.plan-state/` when available
- in interactive mode, ask targeted follow-up questions in rounds
- use assumption statement, ambiguity resolution, tradeoff review, and validation criteria as the default Progressive Discover structure
- in interactive mode, enforce minimum rounds from `plan.interaction_depth`: low=2, medium=3, high=5
- in interactive mode, do not enter P2 until the user explicitly says「够了」「开始吧」「可以了」or equivalent
- if context is injected, present it before the first question round but do not skip Discover

Supported flags:

- none

Behavior:

- load `plan/PLAN-SKILL.md`

## Compatibility Notes

- `开始执行` is the natural-language equivalent of `/hw:start`
- `继续`, `下一步`, `执行下一步` are natural-language equivalents of `/hw:resume`
- `pipeline status`, `状态` are natural-language equivalents of `/hw:status`
- `跳过当前步骤` remains a step-level skip and is not the same as `/hw:skip`
- `中止`, `abort` remain hard-abort operations and are not the same as `/hw:stop`
- `/hw:plan` enters planning mode and is not the same as `/hw:start`
- `/hw:chat` is lightweight append conversation and is not the same as `/hw:patch`
- `/hw:plan:extend` appends to an active Cycle and is not the same as opening a new Cycle
- `/hw:plan:review` is a planning review surface and not the same as `review_code`
- `/hw:cycle` manages Cycle metadata and archives, not normal milestone execution
- `/hw:patch` manages persistent side-track issues, not prompt patch queues under `.plan-state/`
- `/hw:review --full` remains a legacy compatibility reminder only
- slash commands are entry shortcuts only; they do not change TDD, evaluation, or delegation semantics
