# State Contract

This file defines the full `state.yaml` contract used by the pipeline.

## Top-Level Structure

```yaml
pipeline:
  name: ""
  status: idle | running | blocked | aborted | stopped | completed
  prompts_total: 0
  prompts_completed: 0
  started: null
  finished: null
last_heartbeat: null
current:
  phase: idle | plan_discover | plan_decompose | plan_generate | plan_confirm | executing | lifecycle_init | lifecycle_check | lifecycle_audit | lifecycle_release | lifecycle_debug | lifecycle_cycle | lifecycle_patch | completed
  prompt_index: 0
  prompt_file: null
  prompt_name: null
  step: null
  step_index: 0
milestones: []
prompt_state:
  started_at: null
  updated_at: null
  finished_at: null
  result: running | pass | blocked | aborted | stopped | skipped
  diff_score: null
  code_quality: null
  analysis_summary: null
  steps: []
history:
  completed_prompts: []
chat: {}
acceptance: {}
continuation: {}
```

## Cycle Workflow Metadata

Cycle-level workflow truth lives in `.pipeline/cycle.yaml`, not in `state.yaml`.
`state.yaml` may mirror only the currently active continuation. The Cycle schema uses:

```yaml
cycle:
  workflow_kind: build | analysis | showcase
  analysis_kind: root_cause | metric | repo_system
  type: feature | analysis | showcase
  lifecycle_policy:
    reject:
      default_action: needs_revision
    accept:
      next: complete | auto_continue | follow_up_plan
    resume:
      default_action: continue_current | continue_revision
    gates:
      acceptance: auto | confirm | manual_qa
    auto_continue: true
  continuations:
    - id: C5-follow-up
      kind: follow_up_plan
      status: planned | active | done | blocked
      prompt_ref: .pipeline/plan-continuations/C5-follow-up.yaml
```

Rules:

- `workflow_kind` is Cycle-scoped and is the single source for Plan, Start, Status, Report, Acceptance, and platform boundary semantics inside one Cycle.
- `cycle.type` is a legacy/internal alias derived from `workflow_kind`; it must not become a second user-facing taxonomy.
- `execution.steps.preset` defaults from `workflow_kind`: `analysis -> analysis`, `showcase -> implement-only`, `build -> tdd`.
- `lifecycle_policy.reject.default_action` defaults to `needs_revision`.
- `cycle.continuations[]` is the authority for planned follow-up nodes. `state.yaml` only mirrors the active continuation.

Canonical user-facing phases are:

- `planning`
- `ready_to_start`
- `executing`
- `pending_acceptance`
- `needs_revision`
- `accepted`
- `follow_up_planning`
- `blocked`
- `completed`

Status surfaces should derive one canonical phase and one next action from Cycle metadata, state, acceptance, and continuation facts.

## Milestone Record Fields

Each `milestones[]` item may contain:

- `name`
- `status`
- `deferred_reason`

Allowed milestone status values:

- `done`
- `in_progress`
- `deferred`
- `failed`
- `skipped`

## Step Record Fields

Each `prompt_state.steps[]` item may contain:

- `name`
- `status`
- `executor`
- `subagent_tool`
- `subagent_result`
- `reason`
- `started_at`
- `finished_at`
- `duration_seconds`
- `notes`

## Analysis State Summary

`prompt_state.analysis_summary` is optional and is used by analysis Milestones to keep resume/status/watchdog/report surfaces useful without turning `.pipeline/state.yaml` into an evidence database.

Suggested shape:

```yaml
prompt_state:
  analysis_summary:
    milestone_id: M06
    question: "Why did the metric change?"
    ledger_path: .pipeline/analysis/M06-analysis-ledger.yaml
    hypothesis_counts:
      total: 2
      confirmed: 1
      disproved: 1
      partial: 0
      pending: 0
    experiment_counts:
      total: 2
      completed: 2
      blocked: 0
      pending: 0
    conclusion: "Most likely explanation."
    confidence: high
    updated_at: 2026-05-02T13:00:00+08:00
```

Boundary rules:

- `prompt_state.analysis_summary` must include `ledger_path` when a ledger exists.
- `state.yaml` must not store full hypotheses.
- `state.yaml` must not store full experiments.
- `state.yaml` must not store full observations.
- Full evidence belongs in `.pipeline/analysis/<milestone-id>-analysis-ledger.yaml`.
- Hypothesis backtracking should update the ledger and summary counts; it must not require rolling back `current.step`.

## Read / Write Timing

Write `state.yaml` at these moments:

- pipeline initialization
- prompt start
- step start
- step finish
- any skip cascade update
- prompt skip
- graceful stop
- prompt finish
- prompt blocked
- abort or restart

Protected lifecycle writes must go through the workflow commit helper instead of direct ad hoc file writes. The helper contract is:

- prevalidate the next authoritative snapshot before writing `.pipeline/state.yaml`, `.pipeline/cycle.yaml`, or `.pipeline/rules.yaml`
- write authority files with temp-file atomic replacement
- run post-write invariants for step pointers, rejected acceptance state, prompt completion counts, and follow-up continuation state
- refresh affected derived views such as `.pipeline/log.yaml`, `.pipeline/PROGRESS.md`, metrics mirrors, compact views, project summaries, and OpenCode status inputs as derived targets
- if authority commits but a derived refresh fails, keep authority committed, write `.pipeline/derived-refresh.yaml`, return a warning/failure status, and tell the user to repair with `/hw:sync --light` or rerun the lifecycle command after fixing the derived artifact

Read `state.yaml` at these moments:

- `start pipeline`
- `continue`
- `pipeline status`
- `/hw:resume`
- `/hw:status`
- `/hw:skip`
- `/hw:stop`
- `/hw:report`
- `skip step`
- `abort`
- `/hw:chat`
- `/hw:chat end`

## Field Dependencies

- `current.step` must always point to the next runnable or currently running step.
- `current.step_index` must match the index of `current.step` inside `prompt_state.steps`.
- `current.phase` should reflect whether the system is in planning, execution, lifecycle, or completion state.
- `last_heartbeat` should be updated with an ISO-8601 timestamp whenever execution state is persisted during `/hw:start` or `/hw:resume`.
- `.pipeline/.lock` is a structured execution lease, not a bare sentinel file.
- Execution leases include `schema_version`, `platform`, `session_id`, `owner`, `command`, `phase`, `created_at`, `heartbeat_at`, `expires_at`, `workflow_kind`, `cycle_id`, and `handoff_allowed`.
- Fresh foreign leases block resume. Expired leases may be taken over and must log `lease_takeover` evidence.
- Platform-reported failures should be recorded as `reported_failure`; timeout-only recovery is `inferred_stall`.
- Malformed leases require repair guidance instead of silent deletion.
- `pipeline.prompts_completed` must equal the number of successful prompt entries in `history.completed_prompts`.
- `prompt_state.diff_score` drives the final decision gate.
- `prompt_state.code_quality` informs the `code_quality` evaluation check.
- `executor=subagent` implies `subagent_tool` is not null and `subagent_result` should exist unless parsing failed.
- `status=skipped` should carry a `reason`.
- `milestones[].status=deferred` should carry `deferred_reason`.
- `pipeline.status=stopped` means the run is intentionally paused and resumable.
- `prompt_state.result=stopped` means the current prompt was paused mid-flight and should resume from `current.step`.
- prompt-level `result=skipped` should not increment `pipeline.prompts_completed`.
- `history.completed_prompts` is a legacy field name and may contain non-pass entries such as `blocked`, `aborted`, or `skipped`.
- optional `chat.*` state must never replace Cycle / Milestone / Patch state; it only annotates an append conversation lane.
- optional `prompt_state.analysis_summary` must stay compact and must never replace the analysis ledger.
- Knowledge Ledger records must stay outside `state.yaml`; if a future status, resume, or SessionStart surface needs recovery context, store only compact/index pointers such as `.pipeline/knowledge/knowledge.compact.md` and `.pipeline/knowledge/index/*.yaml`.
- optional `acceptance.*` state is a compact mirror for status and TUI surfaces; Cycle-level truth stays in `.pipeline/cycle.yaml`.
- `acceptance.feedback_ref` may point to structured rejection feedback under `.pipeline/acceptance/`.
- `state.yaml` must not store full acceptance or rejection feedback text.
- `current.phase=needs_revision` means `/hw:resume` should continue the revision path using `acceptance.feedback_ref` as input instead of resuming a completed step.
- `current.phase=follow_up_planning` means accepted work is waiting to start the active `continuation` record.

## Acceptance State

`acceptance:` is optional and mirrors minimal acceptance status for resume, status, and OpenCode TUI surfaces.

Suggested fields:

```yaml
acceptance:
  scope: cycle
  state: pending | accepted | rejected
  mode: manual | auto | timeout
  cycle_id: C4
  requested_at: 2026-05-03T00:10:00+08:00
  feedback_ref: .pipeline/acceptance/cycle-C4-rejection-20260503T001200+0800.yaml
  updated_at: 2026-05-03T00:12:00+08:00
```

Notes:

- Cycle acceptance authority is `.pipeline/cycle.yaml`.
- Patch acceptance authority belongs to Patch metadata.
- Full feedback belongs in `feedback_ref`, not in `state.yaml`.
- Timeout acceptance is a deterministic status/check decision. Status surfaces may display `accepted`, `timed_out: true`, and `automatic: true` after the configured timeout, but no background runner should rewrite `state.yaml`.
- Rejection feedback files should be structured with `problem`, `reproduce_steps`, `expected`, `actual`, `context`, `iteration`, and `created_at`. A compatibility `feedback` field may exist for older Patch fix readers.

## Continuation Mirror

`continuation:` is optional and mirrors only the active Cycle continuation for status and resume surfaces.

Suggested fields:

```yaml
continuation:
  id: C5-follow-up
  kind: follow_up_plan
  status: active
  title: Plan build follow-up
  prompt_ref: .pipeline/plan-continuations/C5-follow-up.yaml
  updated_at: 2026-05-03T10:00:00+08:00
```

Notes:

- The authoritative planned list is `cycle.continuations[]`.
- Do not mirror inactive or historical continuations into `state.yaml`.
- A follow-up planning continuation should surface canonical phase `follow_up_planning` and next action `start_follow_up_plan`.

## Chat State

`chat:` is optional and is used for lightweight append conversation state.

Suggested fields:

```yaml
chat:
  active: false
  session_id: null
  started_at: null
  last_activity_at: null
  summary_policy: minimal | full | auto
  related_cycle: C2
  related_milestone: null
  recent_files: []
```

Notes:

- `chat.active` indicates whether append conversation mode is live or should be recovered.
- `summary_policy` distinguishes full chat summary from minimal log-only persistence.
- `related_cycle` and `related_milestone` are references, not ownership transfer.
- `recent_files` is a lightweight recovery aid for context restoration.
- chat mode does not replace Cycle / Milestone / Patch semantics.

### history[].evaluation

每个 Prompt 完成后写入：

```yaml
evaluation:
  diff_score: 1-5
  code_quality: 1-5
  test_coverage: 1-5 | null
  complexity: 1-5
  architecture_drift: 1-5
  overall: 1-5
  adaptive_threshold: 2-5
  warnings:
    - "..."
```

说明：

- `test_coverage` 在非 TDD 模式为 `null`
- `overall` 是加权综合结果
- `warnings` 保存本轮触发的 WARN 条件

### pipeline.adaptive_threshold

仅当 `evaluation.adaptive_threshold=true` 时存在：

- 类型：`integer (2-5)`
- 初始值：`evaluation.base_max_diff_score`
- 更新时机：每轮 Prompt 评估完成后

### prompt_state.evaluation

当前 Prompt 在内存和 state 中应保留当前评估块：

```yaml
evaluation:
  diff_score: 1-5
  code_quality: 1-5
  test_coverage: 1-5 | null
  complexity: 1-5
  architecture_drift: 1-5
  overall: 1-5
  adaptive_threshold: 2-5
  warnings:
    - "..."
```

该块适合在 prompt 完成时复制到 `history[].evaluation`。
