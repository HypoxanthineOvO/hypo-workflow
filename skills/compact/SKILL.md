# /hypo-workflow:compact
## Output Language Rules

📌 输出语言规则：
读取 config.yaml → output.language
- zh-CN / zh：所有用户可见的输出使用中文（PROGRESS、报告、状态提示、错误消息、交互提问）
- en：使用英文
- auto：跟随用户对话语言
内部日志（log.yaml、state.yaml）始终英文。

Use this skill when the user invokes `/hw:compact` or `/hypo-workflow:compact`.

Compact files are derived context views. They reduce SessionStart context size while keeping the source files unchanged.

## Paths

All compact files are written next to their source files:

- `.pipeline/PROGRESS.compact.md`
- `.pipeline/state.compact.yaml`
- `.pipeline/log.compact.yaml`
- `.pipeline/reports.compact.md`
- `.pipeline/patches.compact.md`
- `.pipeline/knowledge/knowledge.compact.md`

Never delete or rewrite the original files while generating compact views.

## Config

Resolve `compact.*` from project config > global config > defaults:

```yaml
compact:
  auto: true
  progress_recent: 15
  state_history_full: 1
  log_recent: 20
  reports_summary_lines: 3
```

If config is missing, use these defaults.

## Command

Supported form:

- `/hw:compact`

## Execution Flow

1. Read `~/.hypo-workflow/config.yaml` if present.
2. Read `.pipeline/config.yaml` if present.
3. Resolve `output.language`, `output.timezone`, and `compact.*`.
4. Scan `.pipeline/` for compressible source files.
5. Generate a `.compact` file only when the source file exists.
6. Report the number of files generated and estimated token savings, for example `已生成 4 个 .compact 文件，预计节省 ~92% context token`.

## Compact Strategies

### `PROGRESS.compact.md`

Source: `.pipeline/PROGRESS.md`

Keep:

- the current Cycle header or current status block when present
- the most recent `compact.progress_recent` progress entries; default `15`
- one summary line per archived Cycle, extracted from `.pipeline/archives/*/summary.md`

Do not include full archived progress files.

### `state.compact.yaml`

Source: `.pipeline/state.yaml`

Keep:

- `pipeline` and `current` sections completely
- `last_heartbeat` when present
- the latest `compact.state_history_full` completed milestones in full; default `1`
- older `history.completed_prompts` entries reduced to `{prompt, status, score_summary}`
- current `milestones` list with names and statuses

`state.compact.yaml` is read-only context and must not be used as the canonical state file for mutations.

### `log.compact.yaml`

Source: `.pipeline/log.yaml`

Keep:

- the latest `compact.log_recent` lifecycle events in full; default `20`
- older events compressed into:

```yaml
older:
  count: <N>
  earliest: "<timestamp>"
  latest: "<timestamp>"
  summary: "<event type counts and notable failures>"
```

### `reports.compact.md`

Source: `.pipeline/reports/`

For each historical report, extract at most `compact.reports_summary_lines` lines; default `3`.

Prefer these facts when present:

- final conclusion or decision
- evaluation scores
- key change summary

Skip the current Milestone report so SessionStart can load it in full when it exists.

### `patches.compact.md`

Source: `.pipeline/patches/P*.md`

Include only closed Patches. For each closed Patch, keep:

- Patch ID
- title
- one-line change summary or commit hash

Open Patch files remain loaded separately in full by SessionStart.

### `knowledge.compact.md`

Source: `.pipeline/knowledge/records/*.yaml` plus generated category indexes.

Keep:

- recent durable decisions
- reusable pitfalls
- important dependencies
- config notes
- redacted secret refs

Full raw knowledge records are not loaded by default. SessionStart loads `.pipeline/knowledge/knowledge.compact.md` and `.pipeline/knowledge/index/*.yaml` only.

## Auto Generation

When `compact.auto: true`:

- regenerate compact views after each Milestone report is generated and the Milestone reaches a final state
- regenerate `.pipeline/knowledge/knowledge.compact.md` when Knowledge Ledger records or indexes changed
- regenerate compact views during `/hw:cycle close` before or immediately after archive summary generation

When `compact.auto: false`, do not generate compact files unless the user explicitly invokes `/hw:compact`.

## Git Tracking

Compact files are derived artifacts. `.gitignore` must include `*.compact.*` so they are not tracked.
