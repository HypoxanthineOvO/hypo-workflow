# /hypo-workflow:rules
## Output Language Rules

📌 输出语言规则：
读取 config.yaml → output.language
- zh-CN / zh：所有用户可见的输出使用中文（PROGRESS、报告、状态提示、错误消息、交互提问）
- en：使用英文
- auto：跟随用户对话语言
内部日志（log.yaml、state.yaml）始终英文。

Use this skill when the user invokes `/hw:rules` or `/hypo-workflow:rules`.

Rules are a standalone Hypo-Workflow dimension alongside skills, commands, hooks, and config. They collect behavior constraints that were previously scattered across `SKILL.md`, hooks, and `config.yaml`.

## Paths

Plugin-distributed rules:

- `rules/builtin/*.yaml`
- `rules/presets/recommended.yaml`
- `rules/presets/strict.yaml`
- `rules/presets/minimal.yaml`
- `rules/template/custom-rule-template.md`

Project-local rules:

- `.pipeline/rules.yaml`
- `.pipeline/rules/custom/*.md`
- `.pipeline/rules/packs/<pack-name>/`

## Severity Model

Use the ESLint-style severity model:

| Severity | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `off` | Disabled; do not load or enforce. |
| `warn` | Print a warning and continue. |
| `error` | Treat as a hard gate and stop execution until resolved or downgraded. |

The severity decides behavior. Labels are metadata only.

## Labels

Supported semantic labels:

- `guard`: pre-execution gates such as `git-clean-check`
- `style`: output and language preferences
- `hook`: hook behavior wrapped as rules
- `workflow`: process preferences such as commit and review policy
- `quality`: repository asset quality checks such as `skill-quality`
- `release`: publication gates such as `readme-freshness`

Custom rules may use these labels or a concise project-specific label.

## Hooks

Supported lifecycle hook points:

- `on-session-start`
- `pre-milestone`
- `post-milestone`
- `pre-step`
- `post-step`
- `pre-commit`
- `on-fail`
- `on-evaluate`
- `always`

Rules may bind to multiple hooks. `always` rules are injected into execution context and should be followed for the whole session.

## Commands

Supported forms:

```text
/hw:rules
/hw:rules list
/hw:rules list --active
/hw:rules list --label guard
/hw:rules enable <name>
/hw:rules disable <name>
/hw:rules set <name> <off|warn|error>
/hw:rules create <name>
/hw:rules edit <name>
/hw:rules delete <name>
/hw:rules pack export <name>
/hw:rules pack import <url>
```

## Loading Algorithm

Build the effective rule table in this priority order, low to high:

1. Built-in rule metadata from `rules/builtin/`.
2. Preset severities from `rules/presets/<extends>.yaml`.
3. Custom rules from `.pipeline/rules/custom/`.
4. Overrides from `.pipeline/rules.yaml` under `rules:`.
5. Temporary command overrides from `--rule name=severity` when a command supports them.

When `.pipeline/rules.yaml` is missing, behave as if:

```yaml
extends: recommended
rules: {}
```

Custom rules with the same name as a built-in rule override the built-in content, but normal severity priority still applies.

## `.pipeline/rules.yaml`

Canonical shape:

```yaml
extends: recommended

rules:
  git-clean-check: error
  commit-format: off
  report-language: warn
  my-lint-rule: warn
```

`extends` may be a string or list. Built-in values are `recommended`, `strict`, and `minimal`. Git rule packs may be referenced as `github:owner/repo` or `gitee:owner/repo`.

## Listing Rules

For `/hw:rules` or `/hw:rules list`:

1. Load the effective rule table.
2. Group by label in this order: guard, style, hook, workflow, quality, release, custom.
3. Show name, severity, hooks, and whether the rule is enabled.
4. Apply filters:
   - `--active`: exclude `off`
   - `--label <label>`: include only that label
5. Finish with totals: enabled count, error count, warn count, off count.

When shell execution is available, use `scripts/rules-summary.sh` as the deterministic summary helper, then present the result in the configured output language.

## Enabling, Disabling, And Setting Rules

For `/hw:rules enable <name>`:

1. Ensure `.pipeline/` exists; if not, tell the user to run `/hw:init`.
2. Create `.pipeline/rules.yaml` if missing.
3. Set `rules.<name>: warn`.

For `/hw:rules disable <name>`:

1. Ensure `.pipeline/rules.yaml` exists.
2. Set `rules.<name>: off`.

For `/hw:rules set <name> <severity>`:

1. Validate severity is one of `off`, `warn`, `error`.
2. Set `rules.<name>` to that severity.
3. Preserve unrelated rules and `extends`.

Use structured YAML edits where possible. Do not rewrite unrelated project config.

## Creating Custom Rules

For `/hw:rules create <name>`:

1. Validate the name matches `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`.
2. Ask interactively for:
   - label: `guard`, `style`, `hook`, or `workflow`
   - severity: `off`, `warn`, or `error`
   - hook point: one or more supported hooks
   - natural-language rule body
3. Create `.pipeline/rules/custom/<name>.md`.
4. Add or update `.pipeline/rules.yaml` with `rules.<name>: <severity>`.
5. Show the created file path.

Generated Markdown format:

```markdown
# my-test-rule

- **标签**: workflow
- **严格度**: warn
- **钩子点**: pre-commit

## 规则内容

每次 commit 前检查是否有超过 3 个 TODO 注释。如果有，提醒我处理。
```

Do not auto-create a custom rule without the user's natural-language content.

## Editing And Deleting Custom Rules

For `/hw:rules edit <name>`:

1. Locate `.pipeline/rules/custom/<name>.md` or pack/custom YAML with the same name.
2. If shell editor access is not appropriate, print the file path and explain the editable fields.
3. Do not edit built-in rules in `rules/builtin/`; tell the user to override severity or create a custom rule instead.

For `/hw:rules delete <name>`:

1. Delete only project-local custom rule files.
2. Remove or set off the `.pipeline/rules.yaml` override.
3. Never delete built-in distributed rules.

## Rule Packs

Rule pack format:

```text
hw-rules-example/
├── pack.yaml
├── rules/
│   └── prefer-chinese-comments.md
└── README.md
```

`pack.yaml`:

```yaml
name: hw-rules-example
author: example
version: 1.0.0
description: Example rule pack
rules:
  prefer-chinese-comments: warn
```

For `/hw:rules pack export <name>`:

1. Create `.pipeline/rules/packs/<name>/`.
2. Copy active custom rules into `<pack>/rules/`.
3. Generate `pack.yaml` from current effective severities.
4. Generate a short README with import instructions.

For `/hw:rules pack import <url>`:

1. Accept `github:owner/repo`, `gitee:owner/repo`, or a direct Git URL.
2. Clone or copy into `.pipeline/rules/packs/<pack-name>/`.
3. Add the pack reference to `.pipeline/rules.yaml extends`.
4. Report imported rules and effective severities.

Network access may be unavailable; if import cannot run, provide the exact Git command and target path.

## Runtime Enforcement

At each lifecycle hook point:

1. Select effective rules whose severity is not `off` and whose hooks include the current point.
2. Execute built-in `check` logic or read custom Markdown rule body.
3. For `warn`, print a warning and continue.
4. For `error`, stop execution and explain:
   - rule name
   - failed condition
   - how to fix, disable, or downgrade it

`always` rules are injected during SessionStart and should be obeyed continuously. `hooks/session-start.sh` uses `scripts/rules-summary.sh` to include active always rules in `additionalContext`.

## Built-In Rules

The distributed built-ins are:

| Rule | Label | Default | Hooks |
|---|---|---|---|
| `git-clean-check` | guard | warn | pre-milestone |
| `config-valid` | guard | warn | pre-milestone |
| `cycle-closed` | guard | warn | pre-milestone |
| `conflict-check` | guard | warn | on-session-start |
| `report-language` | style | warn | always |
| `progress-timezone` | style | warn | always |
| `progress-verbosity` | style | off | always |
| `commit-format` | workflow | off | pre-commit |
| `auto-continue-threshold` | workflow | warn | on-evaluate |
| `review-strictness` | workflow | warn | on-evaluate |
| `readme-freshness` | release | warn | pre-commit, pre-release |
| `skill-quality` | quality | warn | pre-milestone, pre-release |
| `stop-hook-self-check` | hook | error | post-step |
| `session-start-context-load` | hook | error | on-session-start |

## `/hw:init` Integration

During project initialization, offer a rules preset:

```text
📏 Rules 配置
  [1] recommended — 推荐规则集（默认）
  [2] strict — 严格模式
  [3] minimal — 最小化
  [4] 跳过（后续用 /hw:rules 配置）
```

When selected, write `.pipeline/rules.yaml`. Skipping leaves old behavior compatible, which is equivalent to recommended defaults at runtime.
