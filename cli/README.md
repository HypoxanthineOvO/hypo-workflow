# Hypo-Workflow CLI

`hypo-workflow` is a setup utility, not a runner. It manages global defaults, profiles, adapter sync, doctor checks, and project bootstrap files. Pipeline execution still happens inside Codex, Claude Code, or OpenCode agents.

## Commands

```bash
hypo-workflow setup
hypo-workflow tui --snapshot
hypo-workflow doctor
hypo-workflow sync --platform opencode --project .
hypo-workflow sync --platform claude-code --project .
hypo-workflow sync --light --project .
hypo-workflow sync --deep --project .
hypo-workflow profile list
hypo-workflow profile use opencode
hypo-workflow profile edit opencode --model qwen
hypo-workflow install opencode
hypo-workflow init-project --platform opencode --project . --automation balanced
```

`init-project` works in non-Git directories. Use `--automation manual|balanced|full` to write the stable project `automation.level`; interactive `/hw:init` shows the Chinese labels 稳妥模式, 自动模式, and 全自动模式.

When no command is provided, the CLI runs `setup` on first use and opens the global read-only Ink TUI afterwards. The `hw` bin alias points to the same entrypoint when the CLI package is installed or linked.

The TUI reads `~/.hypo-workflow/config.yaml` and `~/.hypo-workflow/projects.yaml`, shows registered projects, project detail, global config, model pool, and explicit sync/action entries. It does not execute pipelines. Sync modes are light, standard, and deep; SessionStart uses only light external-change detection.
