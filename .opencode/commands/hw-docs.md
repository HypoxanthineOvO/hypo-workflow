# /hw-docs

Canonical command: `/hw:docs`
Route: `docs`
Skill: `skills/docs/SKILL.md`

Load the corresponding Hypo-Workflow skill instructions from `skills/docs/SKILL.md`, then execute the canonical command semantics with any user-provided arguments.
Before acting, inspect the relevant context when present:

- `.pipeline/config.yaml`
- `.pipeline/cycle.yaml`
- `.pipeline/state.yaml`
- `.pipeline/rules.yaml`
- current prompt/report files for pipeline commands
- open patches for Patch commands

Keep this command as an OpenCode-native slash mapping, not a separate runner. The OpenCode Agent performs the work and Hypo-Workflow files remain the source of truth.
