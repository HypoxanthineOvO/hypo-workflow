# Hypo-Workflow managed OpenCode instructions

This file is Hypo-Workflow managed. Edit the source Hypo-Workflow rules/config when possible, then regenerate adapters with `hypo-workflow sync --platform opencode`.

## Runtime contract

- Hypo-Workflow is not a runner.
- The OpenCode Agent performs the actual work.
- `.pipeline/` remains the source of truth for state, Cycle, Patch, rules, PROGRESS, logs, prompts, and reports.
- Use `question` for required user decisions.
- Use `todowrite` for visible plan discipline, especially in `/hw-plan*` commands.

## Protected files

Treat `.pipeline/state.yaml`, `.pipeline/cycle.yaml`, and `.pipeline/rules.yaml` as protected. Unexpected writes should be blocked or require explicit user confirmation.

## Analysis boundary

When `execution.steps.preset=analysis`, read `.opencode/hypo-workflow.json.analysis` before acting.

- `manual`: deny code changes.
- `hybrid`: propose code changes and confirm before editing.
- `auto`: code changes are allowed inside the configured boundaries.
- Service restarts require confirmation.
- System-level dependency installation requires an explicit ask.
- Network, remote-resource, destructive, and external side-effect boundaries must be honored exactly as configured.
